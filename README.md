# Time Series Forecasting and CNN Model 

üìä **Overview**

This repository contains code for Time Series Forecasting using ARIMA seasonal model and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for predicting Power Generation. The provided code demonstrates the steps to load data, preprocess it, build models, and make predictions. 

üìù **Instructions**

1. **Setup Google Drive**: Mount your Google Drive to access the dataset.
    ```python
    from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount('/content/drive')
    ```

2. **Data Preparation for ARIMA Model**: Update the file path for input and output files, then run the cells one by one in the Time Series Forecasting section. Ensure to skip directly to the CNN part if ARIMA model predictions are not required.

3. **Data Preparation for CNN Model**: Update the file path for input data, then run the cells under the CNN Model section. 

4. **Model Training and Prediction**: Execute the cells to train the CNN model and make predictions.

5. **Output Files**: Check the specified output file paths for the predictions generated by both ARIMA and CNN models.
